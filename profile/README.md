# â˜• Of Humble Beginnings and Grand Designs

"Doth not this beginning seem... most humble?"

My companion set down his cup of coffee, gesturing toward the monitor before us. Upon the screen lay but a few lines of code and a list of tasks yet undone.

"Yet it runs, does it not?" I replied with a slight shrug. "Ten souls make use of it, perhaps more."

"Ten souls..." He smiled wryly. "Thy ambition, though modest, is noted."

The aroma of coffee filled our chamber. Beyond the window, the sun descended into twilight. We returned to our keyboards, each keystroke a small victory. One bug vanquished, one feature born, one commit made.

Time, that relentless river, flowed onward.

"Behold this!" One day he summoned forth the dashboard. "A hundred users, concurrent, and climbing still!"

"In truth?" I drew my chair closer. The numbers rose before mine eyes, as if by enchantment.

More time passed. Repositories multiplied like stars in the firmament. Issues accumulated, pull requests merged. We refactored, optimized, and scaled. Sleepless nights gave way to triumphant morns.

"Dost thou recall when thou called this endeavor 'humble'?" I sipped my coffee thoughtfully.

"I do recall it well." He laughed. "And now?"

Upon the monitor, the production environment lived and breathed. Services ran with steadfast reliability. Users grew in number, moment by moment. And still, new features waited in the wings, yet to be born.

"'The end shall be most grand,' was that not thy prophecy?" he mused.

"Nay, this is not the end." I opened a new branch. "'Tis but the beginning."

Beyond the window, another sun set upon our labors. Our fingers danced upon the keys.

And perhaps, one day, these works shall serve the greater good.
